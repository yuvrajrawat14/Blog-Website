                    <h1>Wisdom shines through inner silence of the mind</h1>
                    <p id="date">August 17, 2024, 7:24 AM IST by <a href="#">TOI</a></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that's supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, images, and code are all supported.</p><br>

                    <p>Describing his first spiritual experience Sri Aurobindo said silence was his ‘first positive spiritual experience’ which made the rest of his sadhana possible. He upheld that ‘in silence is wisdom’. Wisdom – true knowledge is the outcome of the inner silence of the mind.
                    </p><br>
                    <div class="block">
                        <p>When it comes to the description of the nature or knowledge of the real, say, Brhmn, Upanishads too prefer silence over speech. Saints such as Rahim even go to the length of saying that those who know the real do not talk about it, and those who describe the real do not know it.</p><br>
                    </div>
                    <p>Speech, as opposed to silence, creates surface ideas and representations that are ‘not true knowledge’. Since speech is an expression of the superficial, the obvious, the common sense experience, and surface thinking, it fails to grasp the in-depth reality and results in wisdom. Therefore, Aurobindo concludes, ‘to throw oneself out too much in such speech’ is ‘more waste of the energy than anything else’. It obstructs ‘the inward listening’ that alone leads to the path of authentic knowledge.</p>

                    <h2>Heading</h2>
                    <p>Aurobindo, on the other hand, defines silence as ‘freedom from thoughts and vital movements – when the whole consciousness is quite still’. The state of deep silence is accomplished when one separates oneself ‘from the thoughts, feels them as coming from outside, and rejects them’ before they enter the mind. Genuine silence, according to him, is not the quietness of mind but a state of consciousness ‘which comes of itself from above when you open to the Divine consciousness’. It naturally penetrates the brain, mind, and body.</p>

                    <h3>Sub-Heading</h3>
                    <p>If there is absolute silence within, it is quite natural that the thoughts on entering and touching it should fall off. It is how the silence of the outer mind usually comes. The thought that comes in a quiet or silent mind is true dynamic thought. It is full of power as it is imbibed with formations ‘which can effectuate or realise themselves’.</p>
                    <div class="block">
                        <p>By silence, he meant ‘a mind free from disturbance and trouble, steady, light and glad so as to be open to the Force that will change the nature’. It is a ‘spiritual condition which combines calm with intensity’.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod. Fusce dapibus, tellus ac cursus commodo, tortor mauris condimentum nibh, ut fermentum massa</p>

                        <h3>Sub-Heading</h3>
                        <p>Though Aurobindo admits that in his case, state of silence dawned instantly on him ‘by a sudden miracle’, in the case of others it can be achieved by a ‘slow process of concentration’. It may take a long time for them ‘to get rid of the random thoughts of the surface physical mind’. It is a slow process and not easy and requires a lot of devotion, faith, and practice. The sadhak must make a conscious effort to reject the thoughts coming from outside so that ‘during the meditation at least the peace and quietude of the mind and vital may be complete’. When the mind is quiet and at peace, the Force can work more easily. It becomes the witness mind – the Purush.</p><br>
